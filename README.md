# QuickCSS Snippets
*ONLY FOR DARK THEME*

The Folder [EverythingAtOnce](https://github.com/Redundakitties/quickCSS-snippets/tree/master/EverythingAtOnce) includes all the snippets in the snippets folder applied to my theme. I will update this readme one day to explain what they all do but their names are fairly self-explanatory. 

The Folder [OnlyCouveTweaks](https://github.com/Redundakitties/quickCSS-snippets/tree/master/OnlyCouveTweaks) is what you want to use. I've copied and pasted everything in Couve's original [app.css](https://github.com/NYRI4/Couve/blob/main/betterdiscord/app.css) file and commented at the very top. All of my changes you can see in the following image, and hopefully followable so you can tweak to your liking :)
