The Folder [EverythingAtOnce](https://github.com/Redundakitties/quickCSS-snippets/tree/master/EverythingAtOnce) includes all the snippets in the snippets folder applied to my theme. There is now a README detailing what each snippet does. Only took me an entire year. 


The Folder [OnlyCouveTweaks](https://github.com/Redundakitties/quickCSS-snippets/tree/master/OnlyCouveTweaks) is what you want to use. I've copied and pasted everything in Couve's original [app.css](https://github.com/NYRI4/Couve/blob/main/betterdiscord/app.css) file and commented at the very top. All of my changes you can see in the following image, and hopefully followable so you can tweak to your liking :) 

## Setup
### If you DO have a theme already installed:
1. Add the contents of this file to the bottom of your theme
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redundakitties/quickCSS-snippets/master/OnlyCouveTweaks/theme_snippets.css"><code>./OnlyCouveTweaks/theme_snippets.css</code></a>

2. Also comment out anything involving `.wrapper-1ZcZW-`, these are on lines [81-104](https://github.com/NYRI4/Couve/blob/c43f6f3364e41aa775b5038baddee2ff8144bead/betterdiscord/app.css#L81-L104) in the original app.css file. That should bring back RoleColorEverywhere. 

### If you DON'T have a theme already installed:
